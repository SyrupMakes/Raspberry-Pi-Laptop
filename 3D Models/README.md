# 3D Models

If your Printer can print 300mm x 200mm then you can print the parts whole. If not, then I designed the parts to be printed in two pieces. It has a 0.1mm tolerance between the parts so they slot tightly together and can then be fused together with a soldering iron. If your printer cannot handle 0.1mm tolerances, then you may need to do some cleanup to make the parts fit together. I may upload a 0.2mm tolerance version in future if there is a need.
